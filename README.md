3 main lessons about "clean code"

- DRY (Don't Repeat yourself)

The code should not be repeated. If the code tend to repeat,
it should be refactored as a function.
- SPR (Single Responsibility Principle)

Function should perform only 1 task and focus on only 1 thing.
- Meaningful name

Naming should be readable, easy to understand and should avoid
disinformation.
Name of variable, function, constant, class and etc 
have difference naming convention, therefore following 
correct convention gives developers a better understanding
in the code.
