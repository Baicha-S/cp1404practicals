## Estimate
My estimate in the first few weeks were not very accurate, 
actual working hour usually more than estimation around 30 - 1 hour.
However, I am able to estimate better because I know my ability, plus more
familiar to the code. There are few week that I could finish as my estimate time.

## Code Reviews
I have learned how to read other's code, and able to guess output by reading other's code.
Being reviewed make me more thoughtful and learn alternate way of code which make code
cleaner from the comment suggested.

## Practical tasks 
I would adjust instruction because it sometimes it makes me confuse what to do.
